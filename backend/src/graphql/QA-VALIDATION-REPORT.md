## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Issues
1. **Prisma Client Generation**: Some compilation errors due to missing Prisma client
2. **Service Dependencies**: Some services may need interface updates
3. **Database Connection**: Requires proper database setup for full functionality

### Limitations
1. **Subscription Transport**: Currently configured for both ws and legacy transport
2. **Schema Complexity**: Large schema may impact startup time
3. **Memory Usage**: DataLoader caching may increase memory usage

## üîÑ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Generate Prisma Client**: Run `npm run db:generate` to resolve compilation issues
2. **Database Setup**: Ensure database connection for full testing
3. **Service Integration**: Update service interfaces for compatibility

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Query Complexity Analysis**: Implement query complexity limits
2. **Caching Strategy**: Add Redis for distributed caching
3. **Schema Stitching**: Consider federation for large schemas

### Security Enhancements
1. **Rate Limiting**: Add query rate limiting
2. **Query Depth Limiting**: Prevent deeply nested queries
3. **Field-Level Authorization**: Implement fine-grained permissions
