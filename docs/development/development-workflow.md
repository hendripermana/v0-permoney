Participants: Full development team
\`\`\`

**Planning Process:**

1. **Backlog Refinement** (1 week before sprint)
   - Review and estimate user stories
   - Break down large stories into tasks
   - Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Identify dependencies and blockers

2. **Sprint Goal Definition**
   - Define clear, measurable sprint objectives
   - Align with product roadmap and priorities
   - Consider team capacity and velocity
   - Account for holidays and planned absences

3. **Task Assignment**
   - Volunteer-based task selection
   - Consider individual strengths and learning goals
   - Balance workload across team members
   - Identify pair programming opportunities

\`\`\`

### 2. Development Phase

#### Daily Development Workflow

**Morning Routine (9:00 AM):**

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Sync with main branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Check CI/CD status
# Review any failed builds or deployments

# 3. Review overnight notifications
# Check monitoring alerts, user feedback, etc.

# 4. Plan daily work
# Review sprint board and prioritize tasks
\`\`\`

**Development Process:**

1. **Task Selection**
   - Pick highest priority task from sprint board
   - Check for blockers or dependencies
   - Coordinate with team members if needed

2. **Feature Branch Creation**

   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout -b feature/implement-budget-creation
   \`\`\`

3. **Test-Driven Development**

   \`\`\`typescript
   // 1. Write failing test
   describe('BudgetService', () => {
     it('should create budget with valid data', async () => {
       const result = await budgetService.create(validBudgetData);
       expect(result).toBeDefined();
       expect(result.id).toBeTruthy();
     });
   });

   // 2. Implement minimal code to pass test
   async create(data: CreateBudgetDto): Promise<Budget> {
     // Minimal implementation
   }

   // 3. Refactor and improve
   async create(data: CreateBudgetDto): Promise<Budget> {
     // Full implementation with validation, error handling, etc.
   }
   \`\`\`

4. **Regular Commits**

   \`\`\`bash
   # Commit frequently with descriptive messages
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(budget): add budget creation validation"

   # Push to remote regularly
   git push origin feature/implement-budget-creation
   \`\`\`

#### Collaboration Patterns

**Pair Programming**

- **When to Use**: Complex features, knowledge transfer, debugging
- **Duration**: 2-4 hour sessions with breaks
- **Roles**: Driver (writes code) and Navigator (reviews and guides)
- **Rotation**: Switch roles every 30-60 minutes

**Code Reviews**

- **Timing**: Create PR when feature is complete
- **Reviewers**: At least 2 reviewers for main features
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours during business days
- **Focus Areas**: Functionality, security, performance, maintainability

**Knowledge Sharing**

- **Tech Talks**: Weekly 30-minute sessions on interesting topics
- **Code Walkthroughs**: Demo complex implementations to team
- **Documentation**: Update docs with new patterns and decisions
- **Mentoring**: Regular 1:1s between senior and junior developers

### 3. Quality Assurance Phase

#### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**

\`\`\`typescript
// Service layer testing
describe('TransactionService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  it('should calculate correct account balance', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle currency conversion correctly', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

// Component testing
describe('TransactionForm', () => {
  it('should validate required fields', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should submit form with valid data', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
\`\`\`

**Integration Testing**

\`\`\`typescript
// API endpoint testing
describe('Transaction API', () => {
  it('should create transaction via POST /api/transactions', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/transactions')
      .send(validTransactionData)
      .expect(201);

    expect(response.body.id).toBeDefined();
  });
});

// Database integration testing
describe('Transaction Repository', () => {
  it('should persist transaction to database', async () => {
    const transaction = await repository.create(transactionData);
    const found = await repository.findById(transaction.id);
    expect(found).toEqual(transaction);
  });
});
\`\`\`

**End-to-End Testing**

\`\`\`typescript
// User workflow testing
describe('Budget Creation Workflow', () => {
  it('should allow user to create and use budget', async () => {
    // 1. Login as user
    await page.goto('/login');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'user@example.com');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password');
    await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');

    // 2. Navigate to budget creation
    await page.click('[data-testid="budgets-nav"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="create-budget-button"]');

    // 3. Fill budget form
    await page.fill('[data-testid="budget-name"]', 'Monthly Budget');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="budget-amount"]', '5000000');
    await page.click('[data-testid="submit-budget"]');

    // 4. Verify budget created
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="budget-list"]')).toContainText('Monthly Budget');
  });
});
\`\`\`

#### Code Quality Gates

**Pre-commit Checks**

\`\`\`bash

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Check commit message format
npx commitlint --edit $1
\`\`\`

**CI/CD Pipeline Checks**

\`\`\`yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop, main]
  push:
    branches: [develop, main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

- `#deployments`: Deployment notifications and status
- `#incidents`: Production issues and responses
- `#random`: Non-work related conversations

**Best Practices**:

- Use threads for detailed discussions
- Use @channel sparingly (only for urgent team-wide issues)
- Provide context when asking questions
- Use code blocks for code snippets
- React with emojis to acknowledge messages

#### Documentation

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

**Severity Levels**:

- **P0 (Critical)**: System down, data loss, security breach
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature broken, significant user impact
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues, limited user impact
- **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, no functional impact

### Response Process

#### P0/P1 Incident Response

\`\`\`
1. Detection (0-5 minutes)
   - Monitoring alerts trigger
   - User reports received
   - Team member identifies issue

2. Initial Response (5-15 minutes)
   - Create incident channel (#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM)
   - Assign incident commander
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Begin investigation

3. Investigation (15-60 minutes)
   - Gather logs and metrics
   - Identify root cause
   - Develop fix plan
   - Communicate status updates

4. Resolution (varies)
   - Implement fix
   - Verify resolution
   - Monitor for stability
   - Update stakeholders

5. Post-Incident (24-48 hours)
   - Conduct post-mortem
   - Document lessons learned
   - Implement prevention measures
   - Update runbooks
\`\`\`

#### Communication During Incidents

- **Status Updates**: Every 30 minutes for P0, hourly for P1
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Immediate for P0/P1
- **User Communication**: Status page updates as needed
- **Internal Updates**: Incident channel for real-time coordination
