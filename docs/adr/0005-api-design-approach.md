# ADR-0005: API Design Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney application requires a flexible, efficient API design that can support complex
financial data relationships, real-time updates, and diverse client needs (web dashboard, mobile
app, third-party integrations). We need to decide on the API architecture that balances performance,
developer experience, and future extensibility.

## Decision

We will implement a hybrid API approach:

**Primary API Layer:**

- GraphQL API using Apollo Server for flexible data fetching
- Comprehensive schema covering all financial entities and relationships
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates (transactions, budgets, prices)
- Efficient data loading with DataLoader pattern

**Complementary REST API:**

- RESTful endpoints for file uploads, webhooks, and third-party integrations
- OAuth2-secured read-only endpoints for data export
- Standardized error handling and response formats
- OpenAPI documentation for external integrations

**API Features:**

- Type-safe API contracts shared between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Comprehensive audit logging for all API operations

## Rationale

**GraphQL as Primary API:**

- Flexible data fetching reduces over-fetching and under-fetching
- Single endpoint simplifies client development
- Strong type system with auto-generated documentation
- Excellent for complex financial data relationships
- Real-time subscriptions for live financial updates
- Introspection capabilities for development tools

**REST for Specific Use Cases:**

- File uploads are more natural with REST endpoints
- Webhook integrations expect REST interfaces
- Third-party integrations often prefer REST APIs
- Simpler caching strategies for certain operations

**Hybrid Approach Benefits:**

- Leverages strengths of both paradigms
- Provides flexibility for different client needs
- Maintains compatibility with existing ecosystem tools
- Allows gradual migration and adoption strategies

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: REST API Only

- **Description**: Traditional RESTful API with resource-based endpoints
- **Pros**: Familiar to developers, excellent caching, simple to understand
- **Cons**: Over-fetching/under-fetching issues, multiple requests for complex data
- **Why rejected**: Financial dashboards require complex, nested data that GraphQL handles better

### Alternative 2: GraphQL Only

- **Description**: Pure GraphQL API for all operations
- **Pros**: Consistent interface, flexible data fetching, strong typing
- **Cons**: Complex file uploads, difficult webhook integrations, caching challenges
- **Why rejected**: Some operations (file uploads, webhooks) are better suited for REST

### Alternative 3: gRPC API

- **Description**: High-performance RPC framework with Protocol Buffers
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, strong typing, efficient serialization
- **Cons**: Limited browser support, complex setup, less familiar to web developers
- **Why rejected**: Web-first application requires browser-friendly APIs

### Alternative 4: tRPC

- **Description**: TypeScript-first RPC framework
- **Pros**: End-to-end type safety, excellent developer experience
- **Cons**: TypeScript-only, less ecosystem support, newer technology
- **Why rejected**: GraphQL provides better ecosystem and tooling for complex data needs

## Consequences

### Positive

- Flexible data fetching optimized for financial dashboards
- Strong type safety across API boundaries
- Real-time capabilities for live financial updates
- Excellent developer experience with auto-generated documentation
- Efficient data loading with reduced network requests
- Future-proof architecture that can adapt to changing requirements

### Negative

- Increased complexity with two API paradigms
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with GraphQL
- More complex caching strategies
- Additional tooling and infrastructure requirements

### Neutral

- Need for comprehensive API testing strategies
- Documentation maintenance for both API types
- Monitoring and observability for different API patterns
- Security considerations for both REST and GraphQL endpoints

## Implementation Notes

1. **GraphQL Schema Design:**
   - Design schema around business domains (Household, Account, Transaction, etc.)
   - Implement efficient resolvers with DataLoader for N+1 query prevention
   - Use GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates
   - Implement field-level authorization and rate limiting

2. **REST API Design:**
   - Follow RESTful conventions for resource naming
   - Implement consistent error handling and status codes
   - Use OpenAPI specification for documentation
   - Implement file upload endpoints with proper validation

3. **Shared Infrastructure:**
   - Common authentication and authorization middleware
   - Unified logging and monitoring across both APIs
   - Shared validation and sanitization logic
   - Common rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schema
   - Share API contracts between frontend and backend
   - Implement runtime validation for all inputs
   - Use code generation for client-side API calls

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement query complexity analysis for GraphQL
   - Use DataLoader for efficient database queries
   - Implement response caching where appropriate
   - Monitor and optimize slow queries
