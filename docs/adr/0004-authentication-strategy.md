# ADR-0004: Authentication and Security Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney application handles sensitive financial data and requires robust authentication and
security measures. We need to implement modern authentication methods that provide excellent user
experience while maintaining the highest security standards. The system must support multi-user
households, session management, and comply with financial application security requirements.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered authentication strategy:

**Primary Authentication:**

- WebAuthn/Passkey authentication with biometric support (FaceID, TouchID, fingerprint)
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- PIN-based authentication as fallback when biometrics are unavailable

**Session Management:**

- Redis-based session storage with configurable timeouts
- Idle timeout (15 minutes) and absolute timeout (8 hours) following POSBB standards
- Automatic logout and re-authentication for sensitive operations

**Security Measures:**

- HTTPS enforcement with HSTS headers
- CSRF protection with double-submit cookies
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Data-at-rest encryption for sensitive information
- Comprehensive audit logging for all authentication events

## Rationale

**WebAuthn/Passkey Choice:**

- Industry-standard for passwordless authentication
- Excellent user experience with biometric authentication
- Phishing-resistant and eliminates password-related vulnerabilities
- Future-proof technology with growing browser and device support
- Reduces user friction while increasing security

**JWT with Refresh Tokens:**

- Stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems
- Refresh token rotation prevents token replay attacks
- Configurable expiration times for different security levels
- Good balance between security and user experience

**Redis Session Storage:**

- High-performance session management
- Centralized session control for multi-instance deployments
- Easy session invalidation and timeout management
- Supports real-time session monitoring and analytics

**Comprehensive Security Measures:**

- Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers
- Compliance with financial application security standards
- Protection against common web application vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive audit trail for security monitoring

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Traditional Username/Password Only

- **Description**: Standard email/password authentication with optional 2FA
- **Pros**: Familiar to users, simple implementation, wide compatibility
- **Cons**: Vulnerable to password attacks, poor user experience, security risks
- **Why rejected**: Insufficient security for financial applications, poor UX

### Alternative 2: OAuth2 with Third-Party Providers

- **Description**: Authentication via Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.
- **Pros**: Easy implementation, familiar to users, reduced password management
- **Cons**: Dependency on third parties, privacy concerns, limited control
- **Why rejected**: Financial applications require direct control over authentication

### Alternative 3: SMS-based OTP Authentication

- **Description**: SMS one-time passwords as primary authentication
- **Pros**: Wide device compatibility, familiar to users
- **Cons**: SIM swapping attacks, SMS delivery issues, poor user experience
- **Why rejected**: Security vulnerabilities and reliability issues

### Alternative 4: Database Session Storage

- **Description**: Storing sessions in PostgreSQL instead of Redis
- **Pros**: Single database dependency, ACID compliance for sessions
- **Cons**: Performance overhead, database load, slower session operations
- **Why rejected**: Redis provides better performance for session management

## Consequences

### Positive

- Excellent user experience with biometric authentication
- Strong security posture suitable for financial applications
- Phishing-resistant authentication methods
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
- Scalable session management architecture
- Future-proof authentication technology

### Negative

- Complexity in implementing WebAuthn across different browsers/devices
- Fallback mechanisms needed for devices without biometric support
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with WebAuthn
- Additional infrastructure requirements (Redis)

### Neutral

- Need for comprehensive testing across different devices and browsers
- Regular security audits and penetration testing required
- User education about new authentication methods
- Monitoring and alerting for authentication anomalies

## Implementation Notes

1. **WebAuthn Implementation:**
   - Use `@simplewebauthn/server` and `@simplewebauthn/browser` libraries
   - Implement registration and authentication flows
   - Store credential data securely in database
   - Handle cross-platform compatibility issues

2. **JWT Configuration:**
   - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) with rotation
   - Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies
   - Token blacklisting for logout functionality

3. **Session Management:**
   - Redis configuration with appropriate TTL settings
   - Session data encryption and secure serialization
   - Concurrent session limits per user
   - Session monitoring and analytics

4. **Security Headers:**
   - HTTPS enforcement with HSTS
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
   - X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options
   - CSRF protection middleware

5. **Audit Logging:**
   - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Session creation and termination
   - Sensitive operation access
   - Security event monitoring and alerting
