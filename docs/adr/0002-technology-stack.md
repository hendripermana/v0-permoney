# ADR-0002: Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney Enterprise Redesign requires a modern, scalable technology stack that can support
complex financial operations, multi-user households, real-time features, and future mobile
expansion. We need to select technologies that provide excellent developer experience, strong
ecosystem support, and proven scalability for financial applications.

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

**Frontend:**

- Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for design system
- Framer Motion for animations
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tanstack Query for state management
- Apollo Client for GraphQL integration

**Backend:**

- NestJS with TypeScript for API development
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence
- GraphQL with Apollo Server for flexible data queries
- Redis for caching and session management
- BullMQ for background job processing

**Database & Analytics:**

- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- Redis for caching and real-time features

## Rationale

**Frontend Choices:**

- **Next.js**: Excellent SSR/SSG capabilities, strong ecosystem, optimal for SEO and performance
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind**: Modern, accessible component library with excellent customization
- **TypeScript**: Type safety crucial for financial applications
- **Tanstack Query**: Excellent caching and synchronization for financial data

**Backend Choices:**

- **NestJS**: Modular architecture, excellent TypeScript support, enterprise-ready
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database access, excellent migration system, great developer experience
- **GraphQL**: Flexible data fetching crucial for complex financial dashboards
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance essential for financial data, excellent JSON support

**Infrastructure Choices:**

- **TimescaleDB**: Optimized for time-series financial data and analytics
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and real-time features
- **BullMQ**: Reliable job processing for financial calculations and notifications

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: React + Express.js

- **Description**: Traditional React SPA with Express.js backend
- **Pros**: Simpler setup, more flexibility in routing
- **Cons**: Manual SSR setup, less optimized for SEO, more configuration needed
- **Why rejected**: Next.js provides better out-of-the-box optimization and developer experience

### Alternative 2: Vue.js + Fastify

- **Description**: Vue.js frontend with Fastify backend
- **Pros**: Lightweight, good performance
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less TypeScript integration, fewer financial app examples
- **Why rejected**: Next.js + NestJS provides better enterprise-grade features

### Alternative 3: Django + React

- **Description**: Django REST framework with React frontend
- **Pros**: Mature framework, excellent admin interface, strong ORM
- **Cons**: Python vs TypeScript consistency, less real-time capabilities
- **Why rejected**: TypeScript consistency across stack is crucial for financial applications

### Alternative 4: MongoDB for database

- **Description**: Using MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, good for rapid prototyping
- **Cons**: No ACID transactions, less suitable for financial data, complex queries
- **Why rejected**: ACID compliance is non-negotiable for financial applications

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong type safety across the entire stack with TypeScript
- Excellent developer experience with modern tooling
- Scalable architecture suitable for enterprise applications
- Strong ecosystem support and community
- Built-in optimization for performance and SEO
- Reliable data consistency for financial operations

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the stack
- Potential over-engineering for simple features
- Dependency on multiple frameworks and libraries
- Need for careful version management across the stack

### Neutral

- Regular updates required to stay current with ecosystem changes
- Need for comprehensive testing strategy across multiple technologies
- Documentation and training required for team onboarding

## Implementation Notes

1. Set up Next.js with TypeScript and App Router configuration
2. Configure shadcn/ui with custom theme and Tailwind CSS
3. Initialize NestJS with modular architecture and Prisma integration
4. Set up PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
5. Configure Redis for caching and session management
6. Implement GraphQL schema and resolvers
7. Set up development and production Docker configurations
