# Architecture Decision Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for making and documenting architectural decisions in the
Permoney Enterprise Redesign project. Following a structured decision-making process ensures that
all architectural choices are well-considered, documented, and can be revisited or challenged in the
future.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an Architecture Decision Record when:

### Technical Decisions

- Choosing between different technology stacks or frameworks
- Selecting databases, caching solutions, or infrastructure components
- Deciding on architectural patterns (microservices vs monolith, event sourcing, etc.)
- Establishing coding standards, conventions, or development practices

### Design Decisions

- API design approaches (REST vs GraphQL vs RPC)
- Data modeling strategies and database schema design
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Integration patterns with external services

### Process Decisions

- Development workflows and branching strategies
- Testing strategies and quality assurance processes
- Deployment and infrastructure approaches
- Monitoring and observability strategies

### Impact-Based Criteria

- Decisions that affect multiple teams or components
- Choices with long-term implications (> 6 months)
- Decisions involving significant trade-offs
- Precedent-setting choices that will guide future decisions

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Problem Identification

- **Trigger**: Identify the architectural issue or decision point
- **Context**: Document the current situation and constraints
- **Stakeholders**: Identify who is affected by this decision
- **Timeline**: Establish when the decision needs to be made

### 2. Research and Analysis

- **Options**: Identify 3-5 viable alternatives
- **Criteria**: Define evaluation criteria (performance, cost, maintainability, etc.)
- **Investigation**: Research each option thoroughly
- **Prototyping**: Create proof-of-concepts if necessary

### 3. Stakeholder Consultation

- **Technical Review**: Consult with relevant technical experts
- **Business Impact**: Consider business and user impact
- **Team Input**: Gather input from affected team members
- **External Expertise**: Consult external experts if needed

### 4. Decision Making

- **Evaluation**: Score each option against defined criteria
- **Trade-offs**: Clearly identify and document trade-offs
- **Recommendation**: Make a clear recommendation with rationale
- **Approval**: Get approval from appropriate stakeholders

### 5. Documentation

- **ADR Creation**: Create ADR using the standard template
- **Review**: Have the ADR reviewed by relevant team members
- **Publication**: Publish the ADR and update the index
- **Communication**: Communicate the decision to all stakeholders

## Decision Criteria Framework

### Technical Criteria

- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, scalability
- **Reliability**: Uptime, fault tolerance, disaster recovery

### Business Criteria

- **Cost**: Initial investment, ongoing operational costs
- **Time to Market**: Development speed, deployment complexity
- **Risk**: Technical risk, vendor lock-in, skill availability
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, industry standards
- **User Experience**: Performance, accessibility, usability

### Team Criteria

- **Expertise**: Team familiarity and learning curve
- **Productivity**: Development efficiency and tooling
- **Hiring**: Availability of skilled developers
- **Support**: Community support and documentation
- **Future**: Long-term viability and evolution path

## Evaluation Matrix Template

| Criteria        | Weight   | Option A    | Score A | Option B    | Score B | Option C    | Score C |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Performance     | 20%      | Description | 8/10    | Description | 6/10    | Description | 9/10    |
| Cost            | 15%      | Description | 7/10    | Description | 9/10    | Description | 5/10    |
| Maintainability | 25%      | Description | 9/10    | Description | 7/10    | Description | 8/10    |
| Security        | 20%      | Description | 8/10    | Description | 8/10    | Description | 9/10    |
| Team Expertise  | 20%      | Description | 6/10    | Description | 9/10    | Description | 7/10    |
| **Total**       | **100%** |             | **7.6** |             | **7.8** |             | **7.6** |

## Review and Update Process

### Regular Reviews

- **Quarterly**: Review all active ADRs for relevance
- **Project Milestones**: Assess ADR effectiveness at major milestones
- **Technology Updates**: Review when major technology updates occur
- **Team Changes**: Review when team composition changes significantly

### Update Triggers

- **New Information**: When new information affects the decision
- **Changed Requirements**: When business requirements change
- **Technology Evolution**: When chosen technologies evolve significantly
- **Performance Issues**: When decisions lead to performance problems

### Update Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate if the original decision is still valid
2. **New ADR**: Create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
3. **Migration Plan**: Document migration path if changes are needed
4. **Communication**: Inform all stakeholders of the change
