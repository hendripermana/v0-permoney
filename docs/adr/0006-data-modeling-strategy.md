# ADR-0006: Data Modeling Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney application requires a comprehensive data model that can accurately represent complex
financial relationships, support multi-user households, handle multi-currency operations, and
maintain data integrity for financial transactions. We need to establish a data modeling strategy
that balances normalization, performance, and flexibility while ensuring compliance with accounting
principles.

## Decision

We will implement a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach with the following data modeling strategy:

**Core Modeling Principles:**

- Double-entry accounting with ledger entries for all financial transactions
- Multi-tenant architecture with household-based data isolation
- Event sourcing for user behavior tracking and audit trails
- Normalized relational design with strategic denormalization for performance
- Multi-currency support with historical exchange rate tracking

**Domain Models:**

- **Household Domain**: Multi-user financial management with role-based access
- **Account Domain**: Multi-currency accounts with institution relationships
- **Transaction Domain**: Double-entry transactions with comprehensive metadata
- **Debt Domain**: Support for personal, conventional, and Islamic financing
- **Budget Domain**: Envelope-based budgeting with AI recommendations
- **Analytics Domain**: Time-series data with materialized views for performance

## Rationale

**Domain-Driven Design:**

- Aligns data model with business logic and financial concepts
- Provides clear boundaries between different financial domains
- Enables modular development and maintenance
- Facilitates communication between technical and business teams

**Double-Entry Accounting:**

- Ensures mathematical accuracy of all financial operations
- Provides complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Enables accurate financial reporting and balance calculations
- Industry standard for financial applications

**Multi-Tenant Household Model:**

- Supports Indonesian family financial management patterns
- Provides data isolation and security between households
- Enables role-based access control within households
- Scales efficiently with user growth

**Event Sourcing for Analytics:**

- Captures complete user behavior for AI insights
- Enables reconstruction of system state at any point in time
- Provides rich data for machine learning and analytics
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

**Multi-Currency Design:**

- Essential for Indonesian users with international transactions
- Historical exchange rate tracking for accurate reporting
- Supports both original and converted currency amounts
- Enables currency-specific and consolidated reporting

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Single-Entry Accounting

- **Description**: Simple balance tracking without ledger entries
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, faster development, less storage
- **Cons**: No audit trail, prone to inconsistencies, difficult reporting
- **Why rejected**: Financial applications require double-entry for integrity

### Alternative 2: Single-Currency Design

- **Description**: All amounts stored in base currency (IDR) only
- **Pros**: Simpler calculations, reduced complexity, easier reporting
- **Cons**: Loss of original transaction data, inaccurate historical reporting
- **Why rejected**: Multi-currency support is essential for Indonesian users

### Alternative 3: Document-Based Data Model

- **Description**: NoSQL document structure for financial data
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, easier to evolve, good for nested data
- **Cons**: No ACID transactions, complex relationships, difficult queries
- **Why rejected**: Financial data requires strong consistency and relationships

### Alternative 4: Flat Table Structure

- **Description**: Minimal normalization with wide tables
- **Pros**: Simple queries, good read performance, easier to understand
- **Cons**: Data duplication, update anomalies, difficult to maintain
- **Why rejected**: Financial applications require normalized data for integrity

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong data integrity and consistency for financial operations
- Complete audit trail for all financial transactions
- Flexible multi-currency support with historical accuracy
- Scalable multi-tenant architecture
- Rich analytics capabilities with event sourcing
- Compliance with accounting principles and regulations

### Negative

- Increased complexity in data model and application logic
- Higher storage requirements due to ledger entries and event sourcing
- More complex queries for balance calculations and reporting
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with accounting principles

### Neutral

- Need for comprehensive data migration strategies
- Regular maintenance of materialized views and aggregates
- Careful performance monitoring and optimization
- Backup and disaster recovery planning for complex data relationships

## Implementation Notes

1. **Core Entity Design:**

   \`\`\`sql
   -- Household-based multi-tenancy
   households -> household_members -> users

   -- Account hierarchy with institutions
   households -> accounts -> institutions

   -- Double-entry transaction system
   transactions -> ledger_entries -> accounts

   -- Multi-currency support
   transactions (original_amount, exchange_rate) -> exchange_rates
   \`\`\`

2. **Double-Entry Implementation:**
   - Every transaction creates corresponding debit and credit ledger entries
   - Account balances calculated from ledger entries, not stored directly
   - Validation rules ensure accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
   - Audit trail maintained through immutable ledger entries

3. **Multi-Currency Strategy:**
   - Store both original amount/currency and converted base currency amount
   - Historical exchange rates for accurate past transaction reporting
   - Currency-specific account balances and consolidated household views
   - Exchange rate caching and daily updates

4. **Event Sourcing Implementation:**
   - User behavior events stored in time-series tables
   - Event replay capabilities for analytics and debugging
   - Materialized views for performance-critical queries
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Strategic indexes for common query patterns
   - Materialized views for dashboard and reporting queries
   - TimescaleDB for time-series financial data
   - Connection pooling and query optimization

6. **Data Validation:**
   - Database constraints for data integrity
   - Application-level validation for business rules
   - Input sanitization and type checking
   - Regular data consistency checks and monitoring
