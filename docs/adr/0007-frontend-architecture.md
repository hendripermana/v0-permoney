# ADR-0007: Frontend Architecture and State Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney frontend requires a modern, responsive architecture that can handle complex financial
data visualization, real-time updates, and provide excellent user experience across devices. We need
to establish a frontend architecture that supports the complex dashboard requirements, multi-user
household features, and future mobile expansion while maintaining performance and developer
productivity.

## Decision

We will implement a modern React-based frontend architecture with the following components:

**Core Framework:**

- Next.js 14+ with App Router for SSR/SSG capabilities
- TypeScript for type safety across the application
- Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration for mobile-first experience

**Design System:**

- shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS
- Custom design tokens and theme system
- Framer Motion for smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**State Management:**

- Tanstack Query (React Query) for server state management
- Zustand for client-side state management
- Apollo Client for GraphQL state and caching
- React Hook Form for form state management

**Data Visualization:**

- Recharts for financial charts and analytics
- Custom chart components for specialized financial visualizations
- Interactive dashboards with real-time data updates

## Rationale

**Next.js App Router:**

- Excellent SEO capabilities for marketing pages
- Server-side rendering for improved performance
- Built-in optimization for images, fonts, and assets
- File-based routing with layout support
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading

**shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS:**

- Modern, accessible component library
- Excellent customization capabilities
- Consistent design system across the application
- Great developer experience with utility-first CSS
- Strong community support and regular updates

**Tanstack Query for Server State:**

- Excellent caching and synchronization for financial data
- Background refetching and optimistic updates
- Built-in loading and error states
- Offline support and retry mechanisms
- Perfect for financial data that changes frequently

**Zustand for Client State:**

- Lightweight and simple state management
- TypeScript-first design
- No boilerplate compared to Redux
- Excellent for UI state and user preferences
- Easy to test and debug

**Apollo Client for GraphQL:**

- Seamless integration with GraphQL API
- Normalized caching for complex data relationships
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Create React App (CRA)

- **Description**: Traditional React SPA with client-side routing
- **Pros**: Simple setup, familiar to developers, flexible
- **Cons**: No SSR, poor SEO, manual optimization needed
- **Why rejected**: Next.js provides better performance and SEO out of the box

### Alternative 2: Redux Toolkit for State Management

- **Description**: Redux with modern toolkit for state management
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, excellent DevTools, predictable state updates
- **Cons**: More boilerplate, steeper learning curve, overkill for many use cases
- **Why rejected**: Tanstack Query + Zustand provides simpler solution for our needs

### Alternative 3: Ant Design for UI Components

- **Description**: Comprehensive React UI library
- **Pros**: Rich component set, good documentation, enterprise-ready
- **Cons**: Larger bundle size, less customization flexibility, opinionated design
- **Why rejected**: shadcn/ui provides better customization and modern design

### Alternative 4: D3.js for Data Visualization

- **Description**: Low-level data visualization library
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, powerful animations, custom visualizations
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, more development time, complex integration
- **Why rejected**: Recharts provides good balance of flexibility and ease of use

## Consequences

### Positive

- Excellent developer experience with modern tooling
- Strong type safety across the entire frontend
- Optimal performance with SSR and built-in optimizations
- Responsive design that works well on all devices
- Real-time capabilities for live financial data
- Maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the stack
- Complexity in managing multiple state management solutions
- Bundle size considerations with multiple libraries
- Need for careful performance monitoring and optimization

### Neutral

- Regular updates required to stay current with ecosystem
- Need for comprehensive testing strategy across different devices
- Documentation and training for team members
- Monitoring and analytics setup for user experience

2. **State Management Strategy:**
   - Server state: Tanstack Query for API data
   - Client state: Zustand for UI state and user preferences
   - Form state: React Hook Form for complex forms
   - GraphQL state: Apollo Client for GraphQL operations

3. **Component Architecture:**
   - Atomic design principles with shadcn/ui base components
   - Custom financial components (charts, cards, forms)
   - Layout components for consistent page structure
   - Feature-based component organization

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Code splitting with Next.js dynamic imports
   - Image optimization with Next.js Image component
   - Bundle analysis and optimization
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components

5. **PWA Configuration:**
   - Service worker for offline functionality
   - App manifest for mobile installation
   - Push notification support
   - Offline data synchronization

6. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for complex user flows
   - Visual regression testing with Storybook
   - End-to-end tests with Playwright
