# ADR-0003: Database Design and ORM Choice

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney application requires a robust database design that can handle complex financial data
relationships, ensure ACID compliance for financial transactions, support multi-currency operations,
and provide efficient querying for analytics. We need to decide on the database technology, ORM
choice, and overall data modeling approach.

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database with Prisma ORM, enhanced with TimescaleDB extension
for time-series optimization, and implement a double-entry accounting system with comprehensive
audit trails.

**Database Architecture:**

- PostgreSQL 15+ as the primary database
- TimescaleDB extension for time-series financial data optimization
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access and migrations
- Redis for caching and session storage
- Double-entry accounting with ledger entries for all transactions

## Rationale

**PostgreSQL Choice:**

- ACID compliance essential for financial data integrity
- Excellent JSON/JSONB support for flexible metadata storage
- Strong consistency guarantees for financial operations
- Mature ecosystem with extensive tooling
- Excellent performance for complex queries and analytics

**Prisma ORM Choice:**

- Type-safe database access with TypeScript integration
- Excellent migration system with version control
- Auto-generated client with IntelliSense support
- Built-in connection pooling and query optimization
- Great developer experience with Prisma Studio

**TimescaleDB Extension:**

- Optimized for time-series financial data (transactions, prices, rates)
- Continuous aggregates for real-time analytics
- Excellent compression for historical data
- Maintains full PostgreSQL compatibility

**Double-Entry Accounting:**

- Ensures mathematical accuracy of all financial operations
- Provides complete audit trail for all transactions
- Enables accurate balance calculations and financial reporting
- Industry standard for financial applications

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: MySQL with TypeORM

- **Description**: MySQL database with TypeORM for Node.js
- **Pros**: Familiar to many developers, good performance, mature ecosystem
- **Cons**: Less advanced JSON support, weaker consistency guarantees, limited analytical features
- **Why rejected**: PostgreSQL provides better features for financial applications

### Alternative 2: MongoDB with Mongoose

- **Description**: NoSQL database with Mongoose ODM
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, good for rapid development, horizontal scaling
- **Cons**: No ACID transactions across documents, eventual consistency, complex financial queries
- **Why rejected**: ACID compliance is non-negotiable for financial data

### Alternative 3: Drizzle ORM

- **Description**: Lightweight TypeScript ORM alternative to Prisma
- **Pros**: Smaller bundle size, more control over queries, good performance
- **Cons**: Less mature ecosystem, fewer built-in features, more manual configuration
- **Why rejected**: Prisma provides better developer experience and ecosystem support

### Alternative 4: Single-entry accounting

- **Description**: Simple balance tracking without double-entry ledger
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, faster development
- **Cons**: No audit trail, prone to data inconsistencies, difficult financial reporting
- **Why rejected**: Double-entry is essential for financial application integrity

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong data consistency and integrity for financial operations
- Type-safe database operations with excellent developer experience
- Optimized performance for time-series financial analytics
- Complete audit trail for all financial transactions
- Scalable architecture that can handle growing data volumes
- Industry-standard accounting practices built into the data model

### Negative

- More complex initial setup compared to simpler alternatives
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with double-entry accounting
- Additional storage overhead for ledger entries
- More complex transaction handling due to accounting requirements

### Neutral

- Need for careful database migration planning
- Regular maintenance of time-series data and aggregates
- Monitoring and optimization of database performance
- Backup and disaster recovery planning for financial data

## Implementation Notes

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Install PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB extension
   - Configure connection pooling and performance settings
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments

2. **Schema Design:**
   - Implement core entities (households, users, accounts, transactions)
   - Create ledger_entries table for double-entry accounting
   - Set up time-series tables with TimescaleDB hypertables
   - Create analytical views and materialized views

3. **Prisma Configuration:**
   - Configure Prisma schema with all entities and relationships
   - Set up migration workflow with version control
   - Configure connection pooling and query optimization
   - Implement database seeding for development

4. **Accounting System:**
   - Implement transaction creation with automatic ledger entry generation
   - Create balance calculation functions using ledger entries
   - Set up validation rules for accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
   - Implement audit trail for all financial changes

5. **Analytics Optimization:**
   - Create continuous aggregates for common analytical queries
   - Set up materialized views for dashboard data
   - Implement data retention policies for historical data
   - Configure indexing strategy for optimal query performance
