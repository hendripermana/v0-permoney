# ADR-0008: Deployment and Infrastructure Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Permoney application requires a robust, scalable deployment strategy that can handle financial
data securely, provide high availability, and support future growth. We need to establish
infrastructure and deployment practices that ensure data security, regulatory compliance, and
operational excellence while maintaining cost efficiency and developer productivity.

## Decision

We will implement a containerized deployment strategy with the following architecture:

**Containerization:**

- Docker containers for all application components
- Docker Compose for local development and testing
- Multi-stage builds for optimized production images
- Container registry for image management and versioning

**Infrastructure:**

- Oracle Cloud VM for initial deployment with migration path to Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB on dedicated database instances
- Redis cluster for caching and session management
- Cloud storage (AWS S3/Cloudflare R2) for file uploads and backups

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e) before deployment
- Staged deployments (development → staging → production)
- Automated database migrations and rollback capabilities

**Monitoring & Observability:**

- Centralized logging with structured JSON logs
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Health checks and uptime monitoring
- Security monitoring and alerting

## Rationale

**Docker Containerization:**

- Consistent environments across development, staging, and production
- Easy scaling and resource management
- Simplified dependency management and deployment
- Excellent for microservices architecture
- Industry standard for modern applications

**Oracle Cloud VM Initial Deployment:**

- Cost-effective for initial deployment and testing
- Good performance for Indonesian users
- Provides migration path to more sophisticated infrastructure
- Supports compliance requirements for financial data

**GitHub Actions CI/CD:**

- Integrated with our code repository
- Excellent ecosystem of actions and integrations
- Cost-effective for our team size
- Good security features for secrets management
- Supports complex deployment workflows

**Comprehensive Monitoring:**

- Essential for financial applications
- Enables proactive issue detection and resolution
- Supports compliance and audit requirements
- Provides insights for performance optimization

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Serverless Architecture (Vercel/Netlify)

- **Description**: Deploy frontend to Vercel and backend to serverless functions
- **Pros**: Automatic scaling, excellent developer experience, cost-effective for low traffic
- **Cons**: Cold starts, limited control, vendor lock-in, complex for financial applications
- **Why rejected**: Financial applications need more control and predictable performance

### Alternative 2: Kubernetes from Day One

- **Description**: Deploy directly to Kubernetes cluster
- **Pros**: Excellent scalability, industry standard, great for microservices
- **Cons**: High complexity, operational overhead, overkill for initial deployment
- **Why rejected**: Too complex for initial deployment, can migrate later

### Alternative 3: Platform-as-a-Service (Heroku, Railway)

- **Description**: Deploy to managed platform services
- **Pros**: Simple deployment, managed infrastructure, good developer experience
- **Cons**: Higher costs, less control, potential vendor lock-in
- **Why rejected**: Less control over infrastructure needed for financial applications

### Alternative 4: Traditional VM with Manual Deployment

- **Description**: Deploy directly to VMs without containerization
- **Pros**: Simple setup, full control, familiar to many developers
- **Cons**: Environment inconsistencies, difficult scaling, manual processes
- **Why rejected**: Containerization provides better consistency and scalability

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent deployment environments reduce bugs and issues
- Automated CI/CD pipeline improves deployment reliability
- Scalable architecture that can grow with the application
- Comprehensive monitoring enables proactive issue resolution
- Cost-effective initial deployment with growth path
- Strong security posture suitable for financial applications

### Negative

- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Docker
- Additional complexity in local development setup
- Need for infrastructure management and monitoring
- Operational overhead for maintaining deployment pipeline

### Neutral

- Regular maintenance of deployment infrastructure required
- Need for disaster recovery and backup procedures
- Security updates and patch management
- Cost monitoring and optimization

## Implementation Notes

1. **Docker Configuration:**

   \`\`\`dockerfile
   # Multi-stage build for Next.js frontend
   FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci --only=production
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build

   FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
   COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   \`\`\`

2. **Docker Compose for Development:**

   \`\`\`yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     web:
       build: ./apps/web
       ports:
         - '3000:3000'
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/permoney

     api:
       build: ./apps/api
       ports:
         - '4000:4000'
       depends_on:
         - db
         - redis

     db:
       image: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15
       environment:
         POSTGRES_DB: permoney
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
       volumes:
         - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

     redis:
       image: redis:7-alpine
       ports:

   \`\`\`yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main, develop]
     pull_request:
